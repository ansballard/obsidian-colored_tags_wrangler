# Obsidian - Colored Tag Wrangler

**Note by Dev during early development**
> I'm working on my first plugin for Obsidian. It is meant to be a small one that allows you to define a tag that has a specific color you choose.
It's currently very early days (like literally built the MVP now) so a lot of it is still to change. Currently you go through the settings to change the tags, but I hope to learn to do it through a side panel and have actual settings in the settings tab.
I'll leave a link to the repo here, but as I said, it is VERY early days
